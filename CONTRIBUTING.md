# Contributing to Cinder

Cinder is a replacement Home application for the Sony NW-A50 series. It drives Sony's closed
services over binder IPC through hand-recovered vtable offsets, runs as the device's launcher, and
ships setuid-root helpers. **The device has no public DFU or EDL recovery path.**

So the bar here is not "does it compile". It is: *if this is wrong, can the user still get their
player back?*

**Translating?** None of the device risk below applies to you. Follow
[`docs/LOCALIZATION.md`](docs/LOCALIZATION.md): it needs Python and a text editor, nothing else.

## Before you start

Read [`docs/DEVICE_CHECKLIST.md`](docs/DEVICE_CHECKLIST.md) — the safety rules at the top,
especially. Then [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the four rules that exist because something
already went wrong.

## Running the checks

Everything CI runs, you can run locally, and you should:

```sh
tools/host_syntax_check.sh          # C/C++ parse + -Wall -Wextra -Werror, both channels
tools/shell_check.sh                # bash -n + pinned shellcheck over the shell scripts
cinder-home/harness/run.sh          # boots the real main.cpp against fake Sony services
bash cinder-home/tools/test_launcher.sh   # 55 cases over the escape ladder
(cd player && cargo test --release)
(cd installer && cargo test --release)
```

The linter is **pinned** (`shellcheck-py==0.11.0.1`) and CI runs the same scripts you do. A gate
whose version floats is a gate that can turn red with no source change — that has happened here.

### Enable the pre-push hook (one line, once per clone)

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

`main` has gone red three times from pushes that a local check finds in seconds — a dependency gate
that broke on arrival, a truncated buffer in the fault path, and a struct field wired only on the
device path so `cinder-host` and `cinder-sim` would not compile at all. The gap was never
capability; it was that nothing ran between "it works on my device" and "it is on main".
`.githooks/pre-push` closes that: player tests, clippy (`correctness` + `suspicious`), the
installer tests, the C/C++ syntax check and the C++ self-tests, in about 50 seconds.

**It runs those checks on a tag push only.** An ordinary branch push leaves them to CI, which runs
all of them and more. Clippy 0.1.95 panicked on every push made from VS Code, so the hook was
blocking pushes over a compiler bug. A tag push still runs the full check, because `release.yml`
tests only the installer. For a release, the hook is the only player gate before the installers
are built. To run the full check on a branch push, use `CINDER_PREPUSH=full git push`.

Hooks are not cloned, which is why it lives in `.githooks/` and needs the line above. It runs the
DEBUG build rather than CI's `--release`, because the failures it exists for are compile-or-lint
and debug finds them identically for a fraction of the time — so a green hook means "CI should
agree", not "the device build works". That is still `build.sh`. Skip it with `--no-verify` or
`CINDER_SKIP_PREPUSH=1` when you mean to.

`cinder-home/build.sh [stable|dev]` is the only gate that does the ARM link, the GLIBC ≤ 2.23
ceiling and the qemu preflight. **CI cannot do this** — it has no cross toolchain — so a green CI
says nothing about whether the thing links for the device. Run it before claiming a change builds.
It also runs the harness and the self-tests.

## The off-device harness

[`cinder-home/harness/`](cinder-home/harness/README.md) links the real `main.cpp` against faked
Sony service clients, a faked easel framework and a **virtual clock** — sleeping advances a counter
instead of waiting, so hours of device time cost milliseconds. It boots the app and asserts on the
resulting call trace.

If you fix a defect in the shell, add a scenario. It is the only automated thing that can see the
project's recurring defect class (work on a timer, for a condition that cannot change, that nobody
stops).

Be honest about its limits: it cannot see the ABI, the GLIBC ceiling, `dlopen`ed services, or
audio. `system`/`popen` are recording stubs, so every setuid helper "fails" — the **success** paths
of USB-MSC and power-off have no coverage there.

## What needs a device, and what that means

Plenty of this project cannot be verified off-device. That is expected, and the rule is simply to
**say so**. If a change is reasoned from call sites rather than observed on hardware, mark it
DEVICE-UNVERIFIED in the comment and add it to `docs/DEVICE_CHECKLIST.md`. Do not describe a
measurement you did not take.

Probe first: `cinder-probe` has no easel lifecycle and cannot affect boot. Nothing that can affect
boot should happen until a probe run looks clean.

Note `/contents` is mounted **noexec** — push a probe to `/tmp` (tmpfs, executable) and set
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/system/vendor/sony/lib:/system/lib:/usr/lib`, or it will not run.

## Naming: intent, fact, and the difference between them

The project's recurring defect class is **process-lifetime thinking about service-lifetime state**
(`docs/SHORTCOMINGS.md` B1): code that configures a Sony service once and then assumes the
configuration is still there. It isn't, necessarily — services restart, other clients write the
same settings, links drop, and a value you set at boot can be gone by lunchtime.

Three verbs, and the distinction is load-bearing:

| Prefix | Direction | When it runs | The rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apply_*` | intent -> service | a user action | May assume it is being called *because* something changed. |
| `refresh_*` | service -> app | a poll or a listener event | Must never cache the answer as permanent. A service that said "no device" once will say something else later. |
| `reconcile_*` | assert intent still holds | a timer or an event | Must be **idempotent**, must re-read before deciding, and must not assume a previous `apply_` survived. |

Most B1 defects are an `apply_` that should have been a `reconcile_`, or a `refresh_` whose first
answer got cached. Two real examples, both shipped and both fixed:

* The Bluetooth peer name was read once and cached, so the screen listed headphones that had been
  switched off — and worse, the same flag was read as "we are connected", which disarmed the
  reconnect retry and meant the radio never reconnected on its own.
* `GetBtStatus` was believed to mean "connected". It reads `3` during connection *setup* as well as
  when linked, so the check fired early. The address, not the status, is the link.

If you are writing something that has to stay true rather than merely become true once, name it
`reconcile_` and give the off-device harness a scenario for it — that harness exists specifically
because this class of defect is invisible to static analysis.

## Style

Match the surrounding code. The tree is deliberately comment-dense, and the comments carry the
*why* — usually the incident that produced the rule. When you change behaviour that a comment
explains, update the comment in the same commit; a stale comment here is worse than none, because
these are load-bearing.

Record what you measured, not what you assume. "MEASURED 2026-08-26: …" is the house style, and
values recovered from a device should say so.

A comment carries the *why* that is still true after `git blame` is gone: the rule, the measurement
behind it, the trap it avoids. What the code *used to* do, and the story of finding out, goes in the
commit message, `CHANGELOG.md` or an audit — all three exist here (`docs/AUDIT_2026-10-05_ponytail.md`
E1: `main.cpp` is 43 % comments, 80 lines of them narrating earlier versions).

## Reuse before you write

Most of what a change needs already exists. Search for it before writing a new one, and when you
do write a helper that two places need, put it here. Every entry below replaced copies that had
drifted apart.

| You need to… | Use | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Read a value from the renderer in an FFI getter | `read(\|r\| …)` (the default before init) | `player/cinder-ffi/src/lib.rs` |
| Change the renderer from an FFI setter | `write(\|r\| …)`, or `repaint(\|r\| …)` to also draw a frame | `player/cinder-ffi/src/lib.rs` |
| Add an on/off opt-in setting (off by default) | a variant in `Opt`; its save key, Settings row, default and Reset come with it | `player/cinder-ui/src/opt.rs` |
| Step a Settings row through a choice enum, or parse its saved word | `crate::next_in(&ALL, x)`, `crate::from_token(&ALL, token, s)` | `player/cinder-ui/src/lib.rs` |
| Draw a new screen | the kit's rows, strips (`strip`, `strip_ink`) and headers | `player/cinder-ui/src/kit.rs` |
| Turn object ids into tracks in their order | `tracks_in_order(r, &ids, n)` (one query; counts survivors before row `n`) | `player/cinder-ffi/src/lib.rs` |
| Write a file the player must never see half-written | `write_atomic` | `player/cinder-ffi/src/lib.rs` |
| Plain HTTP to the LAN | `cast::http` (`resolve` adds port 80) | `player/cinder-ffi/src/cast.rs` |
| Percent-encode / decode a URL path | `drive::pct_encode`, `drive::pct_decode`; a form value: `remote::url_decode` | `player/cinder-ffi/src/{drive,remote}.rs` |
| Escape text for JSON / XML | `net::json_str`, `cast::escape` / `cast::unescape` | `player/cinder-ffi/src/{net,cast}.rs` |
| A private temp dir for request bodies | `net::private_tmp` (mode 0700) | `player/cinder-ffi/src/net.rs` |
| Bytes as lowercase hex (installer) | `llusbdac::hex` | `installer/src/llusbdac.rs` |
| A monotonic clock in the shell | `now_ms()` | `cinder-home/src/main.cpp` |
| Start the pst framework in a probe mode | `start_probe_framework()` | `cinder-home/src/probe.cpp` |
| The Settings screen in a host preview | `sample_settings(page)`; write a PNG with `write_png` | `player/cinder-host/src/main.rs` |

Prefer the standard library and the crates already in `Cargo.lock` over a new dependency.
`cinder-host` writes previews with `png`, which the player already uses, not `image`.

`tools/reuse_check.py` enforces this table in CI and the pre-push hook: it fails when one of these
patterns is written out by hand again, or a helper here is defined a second time, and names the
helper to use. An on/off setting the loader reads as `v == "1"` must be an `Opt` unless it is listed
in the script's `PLAIN_SWITCHES`. When you add a row here, add its rule there.

## Commits and pull requests

Conventional-ish subjects (`fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`) and a body that says **why**. The history is
the only place some of this reasoning survives.

`main` does not currently require PRs — this is one person moving fast. If you are not that person,
open one: **fork the repository, push your branch to your fork, and open a pull request** against
`superwilso/Cinder`. Outside contributors cannot push branches here directly — that is GitHub's
model, not a sign the change is unwelcome. A draft PR with a rough diff is better than a fix that
stays on one machine.

By opening a pull request you agree that your contribution is licensed under the project's
[licence](LICENSE) (PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0), and that the maintainer may also license it under
other terms.

## Cutting a release

The ARM binaries cannot be built in CI: `cinder-home` needs a glibc-2.23 + libc++-3.9.0 cross
toolchain matched to the player's runtime. So a maintainer builds them and **commits** them under
`cinder-home/dist/`, and CI builds only the installer. The one dangerous failure is tagging a
commit whose `dist/` is stale, which ships last week's binaries with a green tick.
`tools/release.sh` exists to make that impossible:

```sh
tools/release.sh v1.2.3 --dry-run   # verify everything, touch nothing
tools/release.sh v1.2.3             # verify, tag, push
```

It refuses to tag unless all of these hold:

* the tree is clean;
* the installer's version and the player's `cinder_version!()` match the tag;
* every embedded payload file exists;
* a fresh build of both channels matches the checksums in `cinder-home/dist/PAYLOAD.sha256` (a
  changed build rewrites them, and that joins the release commit);
* the installer's tests pass.

It also repacks the `.UPG`s from the current install scripts. It never commits anything: staging
stays yours. Pushing the tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds the Windows and
Linux installers and attaches them, the two `.upg` files and `SHA256SUMS` to a published release.
A tag with a suffix such as `-rc1` becomes a pre-release.

## What not to do

* Do not guess vtable slot indices into Sony services.
* Do not write `/proc/regmon/<chip>/value`.
* Do not commit build byproducts. `*.unstripped` is gitignored; `dist/` is deliberate and stays.
* Do not add a settings option that cannot be undone from the device without a reboot.
* Do not reboot a test device casually — it boots to stock, and the user recovers by hand.
