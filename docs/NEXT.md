# Next — the one list

**Every open next step, to-do and device check across Cinder, Flint, cinder-themes and
cinder-sony-analysis, as of 2026-10-22.** This file is the order, not the procedure. Device rows are
run from [`DEVICE_CHECKLIST.md`](DEVICE_CHECKLIST.md) (safety rules first) and recorded there;
feature state lives in [`../cinder-home/STATUS.md`](../cinder-home/STATUS.md). When something here is
done, delete its line and record the result where its procedure lives. Earlier versions of this
file (battery research in full, Walkman One parity, the 0.3.17 release plan) are in git history.

## Where things stand

| | |
|---|---|
| Cinder | **v0.3.19** is the Latest release (10-20): the PolyForm Noncommercial licence, the installer writing the package Walkman One expects, Bluetooth AAC and SBC XQ as installer options, Simplified Chinese and installer language choice. 0.3.17 (audiobooks, presets, NC with Sony's NC earphones) and 0.3.18 (SD-card playlists) shipped before it. Merged since: #30, the receiver's AAC/LDAC negotiation and codec choice |
| Flint | **v0.2.1** is the Latest release (09-28). **v0.2.3-rc1** is the pre-release (10-18) |
| Open issues | None |
| Open PRs | **#29** track previews (@yin8ruo) and **#31**, the same with the preview made an opt-in install option and its playback hand-off fixed. Waiting on the author's answer on #29, then a device run (End → Play, leaving FM mid-preview, a second preview) |
| Gates | The player and installer tests, the harness, the golden previews and text audit, `cargo fmt --check` (also in pre-push), all run by CI on every PR |

## Reviewing a contributed PR

What the reviews of #24, #29 and #30 came down to. Check these before merging:

1. **New features are opt-in** while they are new: an installer option (`components.conf`, a flag
   in `/data/cinder`), off by default. With it off, the golden previews must not change.
2. **Shared playback code is unchanged for people who do not use the feature.** Diff `main.cpp`'s
   play, resume and queue paths against `main`; a new feature's behaviour belongs behind its own
   state, not in the common path.
3. **Sony IPC slots match the firmware.** A new `bt_slot`/vtable index is checked against the
   class's vtable in the stock library (`readelf -rW` on the `.so` in `artifacts/rootfs_mnt`).
4. **The usual gates pass**, and new strings have translations that draw from the bundled fonts
   (`every_translation_draws_from_the_bundled_fonts`).

`tools/cloud_setup.sh` builds the device toolchain and unpacks Sony's firmware in a fresh Linux
container, if a PR needs an ARM build to check.

## 1. Decisions only the owner can make

| # | Decision | Why it waits on you | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Flint F1, the rest:** sweep only what Flint wrote | The `MUSIC` half was fixed 10-09; a sync still removes files it did not put there. The one open item that can lose a user's files | Flint `docs/AUDIT_2026-10-01.md` Part F |
| 2 | **Promote Flint 0.2.3 to stable**, or leave 0.2.1 as the Latest | Its rc has been out since 10-18 | Flint's tag |
| 3 | **The history rewrite.** Sony's extracted files are out of the tree but in public history | Rehearsed (122.7 → 35.2 MB, every release payload unchanged). A force-push that rewrites every clone; easier the fewer forks there are | [`HISTORY_REWRITE.md`](HISTORY_REWRITE.md) |
| 4 | **The cable escape** (11.4): keep, narrow to a PC data connection, or remove | Needs 11.3 (five quiet boots) first | `DEVICE_CHECKLIST.md` 11.3–11.4 |
| 5 | **Suspend to RAM as the default** when paused off the cable | USB after a resume (33.2) is partial; dev adb does not come back | `DEVICE_CHECKLIST.md` §33 |
| 6 | **Bluetooth auto off on by default.** The largest measured battery lever | You asked to leave Bluetooth as it is (10-18); a recommendation only | [`AUDIT_2026-10-18_sound_power.md`](AUDIT_2026-10-18_sound_power.md) §1 |
| 7 | `enforce_admins` on `main`; code signing (free open-source programme, paid, or unsigned) | Settings and money | `PLAN_2026-09-14.md` E5 |
| 8 | Publish cinder-sony-analysis's **`wm1a-volume-tables`** draft, or delete it | Still a draft; `install.md` links to it | cinder-sony-analysis releases |

## 2. Offline work, optional (no player needed)

Nothing below is needed for what has shipped to keep working. It is what was planned and not
built, in the order it was planned.

**Cinder — sound and battery** ([`AUDIT_2026-10-18_sound_power.md`](AUDIT_2026-10-18_sound_power.md) §3)

1. **Say what costs battery.** Each software effect's row says when it keeps Sony's chain running;
   the mode line says whether the chain runs or is skipped. UI only, about an hour.
2. **Presets, round two:** names (needs the keyboard Search uses) and more than four.
3. **A Battery preset**: one tap to Direct, or Custom with only the DAC EQ.
4. The redesign plan's Part G still describes per-output profiles (2a, 2g); bring it in line with
   presets.

**Cinder — everything else**

5. **The redesign's remaining phases** ([`PLAN_redesign_2026-09.md`](PLAN_redesign_2026-09.md)
   Part F): R3's Library view bar, Search scopes, the sideways page swipe; R4's saved views (*show
   as*, *pin*); R7 the installer's window.
6. Ship `cinder_advanced.conf.example` to the player from the installer and name it on Help.
7. Search results for albums and artists, and audiobooks in Search; Play next on long-press as
   well as the swipe.
8. **G1.7 contract fixtures, the rest:** the palette corpus, a `#TZ/UTC` log, playlist forms, a
   SensMe chunk (`tools/check_contracts.sh`).
9. **Tests for `cinder-audio`** (`SHORTCOMINGS.md` A2): grow `fake_pst.cpp` a service at a time.
10. **2038 (goal 10):** an i64 audit of Cinder's own timestamps.
11. A host benchmark with a 10,000-line playlist; discovering an **unpaired** Bluetooth device; a
    Windows installer smoke test per release (Install → Update → Uninstall → Install).

**Flint**

1. After decision 1: adopt music already on the player by content key (G3.2).
2. E7 the album unit is the top-level folder; E9 refused scrobbles to `.scrobbler.refused.log`;
   E10 the 25 s lossless test; E11 one WinHTTP session for the palette shop.
3. Features in the 10-01 order: G1.1 backup of the player's state, G1.2 health card, G3.1 library
   lint, G1.3 device-aware transfer, G2.1 per-headphone profiles, G1.4 LRCLIB lyrics, G2.2 resume.
4. R6 / Flint 0.3: Setup, convert-on-transfer, Copying, the palette preview, SensMe reasons, the
   SensMe MP3 path.

**cinder-themes:** nothing open. **cinder-sony-analysis:** decision 8.

## 3. Research with no deadline

* **Noise cancelling:** shipped in 0.3.17 for Sony's NC earphones. Left: the ambient filter
  Walkman One deleted, and whether the DAC EQ and the linear amp interact with NC.
* **What each effect costs on its own** (section 4 E): DSEE HX, the normalizer, Vinyl, Clear Bass.
* Whether Sony's receiver keeps `SetAAC`/`SetLDAC` across a restart (asked on #30): if it does,
  "SBC only" in Cinder carries into Sony's own receiver.
* What Sony's six-band waits for (`no desired value, skip`) on stock — 16.5 / 17.6.
* DSEE AI (2B.3) and the SensMe channel id → name table (14.2).
* Two 10 Hz pollers in Sony's services (KeyService `select()`, DisplayService's LED thread): 20 of
  ~36 wakeups a second at idle. Measure off the cable before patching either.
* Other models (ZX300, WM1A/Z, A40, A30): start from antiheroriot's ZX300 branch as a PR.

## 4. Device checks, grouped by what each session needs

Row numbers are `DEVICE_CHECKLIST.md`'s. Most of what shipped from 0.3.13 on is in daily use on the
owner's player and works as a whole; these are the rows nobody has logged one by one. If only one
session happens, make it A.

| Session | Rows | Setup |
|---|---|---|
| **A. New in 0.3.17 → 0.3.19** — first | §37 audiobooks; Sound ▸ Presets (save, load, delete); Sound ▸ Equalizer on the jack opens the DAC EQ, Fit my 10-band curve, the jack switch; the DAC EQ heard at the jack (PLAN_sound §3); 38.1 the queue on Bluetooth and with shuffle; 38.7 NC with an NC earphone; AAC and SBC XQ from the installer, and moving between AAC and aptX HD; the receiver's codec choice (#30) with an iPhone and an Android phone | NC earphones for 38.7 |
| **B. Daily use** — mark as noticed | 19.x–30.x redesign rows, 11.7, 11.12, 13.4, 13.7, 13.8, 15.1–15.5 | none |
| **C. Bluetooth** | 2A.1–2A.5, 2C.1–2C.3, 5.2, 5.3, 21.10, 26.x, 28.2, 28.6, 31.5, 31.6, 32.3, 36.1, 36.2; 38.4 auto off on the jack | headphones |
| **D. The jack rig** | 2B.2–2B.4, 4d, 4e, 13.6, 13.9–13.11, 21.1–21.6, 27.x, 28.x, 32.1, 32.2 | `RE_headphone_amp_modes.md`'s rig |
| **E. Power** | 5.5 a discharge number; one run each way for the DAC-EQ default; per-effect `tools/ssfw_cost.sh` (changes what you hear — not while listening); §33, §34, 36.3–36.5 | `tools/battery_track.sh` |
| **F. Boot and recovery** | 11.3 → decision 4, 11.8, 35.2–35.5 | cable out, current `wbrt` backup |
| **G. SensMe** | 14.1–14.3 | files tagged by Flint and by Music Center |
| **H. Walkman One** | 18.2–18.6, and 0.3.19's installer on a Walkman One player (it picks the package by the player's key) | the W1 player |
