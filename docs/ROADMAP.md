# Roadmap

What is planned for Cinder and Flint, and where help is welcome. Feature state lives in
[`../cinder-home/STATUS.md`](../cinder-home/STATUS.md), and what shipped in
[`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md). To help with anything here, open an issue saying which item
you are taking, or report a result there.

## Built, waiting for a test on a player

Each has a row in [`DEVICE_CHECKLIST.md`](DEVICE_CHECKLIST.md) §41:

- **Low-latency USB DAC**, an installer option that fetches
  [cinder-llusbdac](https://github.com/superwilso/cinder-llusbdac) (zhangboyang's llusbdac, built
  for the NW-A50 kernel), and a Low latency switch on the USB-DAC screen.
- **Bluetooth that sleeps and wakes:** the radio switches off after ten idle minutes and back on
  when the player is used (screen on or any button).
- **Look and buttons:** a list of Winamp skins and cassette tapes to pick from, swapping ⏮ and ⏭,
  dragging a long Winamp title, and your own font from the drive.

## Being built next

1. **USB after a resume.** Done 2026-10-26: USB comes back after a suspend to RAM
   (DEVICE_CHECKLIST 33.2 passes).
2. **A backup tool that can rescue a player stuck in a boot loop.** Built 2026-10-26 as
   `cinder-rescue` (`rescue/`, [`RECOVERY.md`](../RECOVERY.md) Step 3): back up, verify, and
   restore only the partitions a boot loop breaks, only to the player the backup came from. Backup
   and restore have run on one A55 under Windows. Left: a release build, and the help wanted below.
3. **Big view** (Settings ▸ Big view, off by default): 130 % text and 25 % taller rows and touch
   zones. The switch is built; the pages that still break in it are listed, with a direction for
   each, in [`PLAN_big_view.md`](PLAN_big_view.md). A good first contribution: pick one page.

Later: the rest of the redesign ([`PLAN_redesign_2026-09.md`](PLAN_redesign_2026-09.md) Part F:
the Library view bar, Search scopes, the sideways page swipe, saved views, the installer window),
CUE tracks listed in Songs, the RMT-NWS20 remote, and Flint 0.3 (setup, convert-on-transfer,
copying, the palette preview).

## Help wanted

**Testers with a Mac.** The installer has a macOS build (Apple silicon and Intel, one binary). It
is experimental until someone installs and uninstalls with it on a real Mac, on stock firmware and
on Walkman One. The first thing to find out is whether current macOS lets root take the player's
mass-storage interface. Steps are in [`../install.md`](../install.md).

**Device tests.** If you have an NW-A50-series player, the rows in
[`DEVICE_CHECKLIST.md`](DEVICE_CHECKLIST.md) are what turns host-tested features into verified
ones. Read its safety rules first. Grouped by what each needs:

| Session | Rows | Setup |
|---|---|---|
| New since 0.3.17 | §37 audiobooks; Sound ▸ Presets; the DAC EQ at the jack; 38.1 the queue on Bluetooth; 38.7 NC; AAC and SBC XQ from the installer; the receiver's codec choice with an Android phone (LDAC) | NC earphones for 38.7 |
| Standalone features | §39: ATRAC, FM recording, album sound, the volume curve, CUE sheets, the Cassette, Clock and Winamp styles, the guided installer | a `.wsz` skin, a CUE album |
| Daily use | 19.x–30.x, 11.7, 11.12, 13.4, 13.7, 13.8, 15.1–15.5 | none |
| Bluetooth | 2A.1–2A.5, 2C.1–2C.3, 5.2, 5.3, 21.10, 26.x, 28.2, 28.6, 31.5, 31.6, 32.3, 36.1, 36.2, 38.4 | headphones |
| Sony's own firmware | the EQ chain with `preload` on (a +10 dB band must be audible over Bluetooth) | a player on stock firmware |
| Power | 5.5 a discharge number; §33, §34, 36.3–36.5 | `tools/battery_track.sh` |
| Walkman One | 18.2–18.6, and installing a `.UPG` on a Walkman One player | a Walkman One player |

**Research.** Each of these is open and needs no code to start:

- **Buttons on Apple (CTIA) headphones.** Wampy found no difference in `regmon`. A capture of what
  the jack sees on a press would settle whether it can work.
- **What each sound effect costs on its own:** DSEE HX, the normalizer, Vinyl, Clear Bass
  (`tools/ssfw_cost.sh`).
- **Two 10 Hz pollers in Sony's services** (KeyService's `select()`, DisplayService's LED thread):
  about 20 of the 36 wakeups a second at idle. Measure off the cable before patching either.
- **Noise cancelling:** the ambient filter Walkman One removed, and whether the DAC EQ and the
  linear amp interact with NC.
- **DSEE AI**, and the SensMe channel id → name table.
- **Wi-Fi.** The MT8590 has a Wi-Fi radio and the player ships its firmware
  (`/system/etc/firmware/WIFI_RAM_CODE_8590`); Sony's kernel leaves out the driver and `cfg80211`.
  **It works:** built from Sony's own kernel source, an NW-A55 scanned, joined a WPA2 network and
  downloaded at about 8 Mbit/s (2026-11-04). It is now the opt-in install option **Device ▸ Wi-Fi**
  with **Settings ▸ Wi-Fi**: clock sync, ListenBrainz, an update check, internet radio (MP3) and a
  phone remote with upload ([`wifi/README.md`](../wifi/README.md)). Open: WPA3 on a real WPA3
  network, the battery cost, internet radio over Bluetooth, AAC/HLS stations, wireless sync with
  Flint, adb over Wi-Fi, and streaming services.
- **AirPlay receiver.** shairport-sync (its own licence, ALAC and an mDNS responder built in) with
  its `stdout` output into the same path internet radio plays through (jack, or Bluetooth at
  44.1 kHz, which is AirPlay's own rate). Needs a static ARM build; AirPlay 2 needs more (PTP
  timing on privileged ports, FFmpeg).
- **USB audio out to an external DAC.** Sony's player app has USB-host audio output code
  (`UsbHostDevice`, DSD output mode); nobody has tried it with a host cable and a DAC.
- **`cinder-rescue` on Linux and macOS.** It builds for both (libusb) but has only run on Windows.
  A `cinder-rescue dump` of your player (read-only) and a `verify` of it is the useful report.
  Results so far, licences and open questions:
  [`RESEARCH_other_repos_backup_2026-10.md`](RESEARCH_other_repos_backup_2026-10.md).

**Other models** (ZX300, WM1A/Z, A40, A30): start from antiheroriot's ZX300 branch as a pull
request. No code needed to help: if your player has adb (Walkman One turns it on), a map of it is
the first step. `python3 tools/device_map/device_map.py` reads it over adb without changing
anything, scrubs the serial number and addresses, and writes a folder to attach to an issue; the
steps are in [cinder-sony-analysis](https://github.com/superwilso/cinder-sony-analysis#map-your-own-player--nw-a40-nw-a30-and-others).
The harness then boots Cinder's shell on it and lists every path Cinder expects that your model
does not have.

**Translations:** [`LOCALIZATION.md`](LOCALIZATION.md) has the workflow. Every translation has to
draw from the bundled fonts; a test checks it.
