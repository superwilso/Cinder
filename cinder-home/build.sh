# Cross-build cinder-home for the NW-A50 — a real, device-loadable ARM binary.
# VERIFIED 2026-06-24: links clean, needs only GLIBC_2.4/2.17 (device is glibc 2.23), every
# undefined symbol resolves against the device libs. ~2.9 MB stripped ARM PIE.
#
# ── The three things that make this work ──────────────────────────────────────────────
# 1. ABI = libc++ (std::__1), NOT libstdc++. Sony's easel/appmgr/PlayerService symbols are
#    libc++-mangled, so the C++ shell is compiled clang -stdlib=libc++ with the device's
#    libc++ headers, and -fno-rtti (easel::ApplicationBase's typeinfo is a LOCAL symbol in
#    libeaselcore, can't be linked against; we never typeid/dynamic_cast the app).
# 2. glibc 2.23 TARGET. The device is glibc 2.23 (2016); this host's cross-gcc is glibc 2.39.
#    Linking against 2.39 emits GLIBC_2.28..2.34 symbol refs the device's ld-2.23 REFUSES.
#    Fix: a glibc-2.23 sysroot (Ubuntu-16.04 "xenial" armhf .debs) for crt + libc, forced
#    via -B<crt> and the xenial libdirs first (clang otherwise grabs the gcc-13 glibc 2.39).
# 3. The Rust render staticlib (cinder-ffi) and its bundled SQLite must ALSO be 2.23-clean:
#    - SQLite compiled against the 2.23 headers (-nostdinc -isystem <xenial>) with LFS off
#      (-DSQLITE_DISABLE_LFS) and 32-bit time (-U_TIME_BITS) so it uses stat/fcntl/time, not
#      the *_time64 / stat64 / fcntl64 symbols that DON'T EXIST in glibc 2.23.
#    - glibc223_compat.c shims stat/fstat/lstat/fstatat (+64) -> __xstat/__fxstat/... which
#      glibc 2.23 exports as @GLIBC_2.4 (it doesn't export plain stat; SQLite takes &stat).
# See README.md and the project memory for the full derivation.
