/* cinder-voltable — install one of Sony's output volume tables. Setuid root.
 *
 * WHY: the wired volume curve is a table the codec driver loads at boot, and the one this model
 * gets is measurably poor (analysis/RE_volume_pop.md): 40 of the 120 UI steps do nothing —
 * vol 40..60 and vol 100..120 are both dead — and the live steps get coarser toward the top, which
 * is where the volume-change pop is worst.
 *
 * There is a better one. `ov_127x.tbl` is the NW-WM1A's own curve: no dead zones, the whole range
 * usable, and smaller steps at the top. BUT IT IS NOT ON A STOCK PLAYER: only the A50's own 1291
 * tables ship in /system/usr/share/audio_dac, and Cinder cannot ship Sony's files. The installer
 * copies a user's own copy into CINDER_DIR below — from the top of the drive, or from Wampy's
 * sound_settings — and only when its SHA-256 is Sony's (install_cinderhome.sh, 1f3b). With neither,
 * `wm1a` and `w1` fail with rc 4 (source missing) and the stock curve stays.
 * Measured, same instrument, on this unit while the file was there:
 *
 *     vol      0   20   40   60   80   90  100  110  120
 *     stock    4   80  100  100  148  188  228  228  228     <- two dead zones
 *     wm1a     4   44   84  124  164  184  204  224  228     <- monotonic
 *
 * (`ov_1280.tbl`, Walkman One's, measured IDENTICAL to stock — the model swap does not change the
 * volume curve. It is offered here only so that can be re-checked without a reinstall.)
 *
 * A FILE NAME DOES NOT SAY WHICH CURVE IT HOLDS. Walkman One copies its "gain mode" table over
 * /system/usr/share/audio_dac/ov_127x.tbl on every boot, and in its default mode that is the A50's
 * own curve renamed, so `wm1a` read by name loaded the stock curve on every Walkman One player.
 * Each key therefore names the table by CONTENT — the 8-byte sum/xor every table ends with — and
 * tries a fixed list of places, W1's untouched copies in /system/etc/.mod/gain included, taking the
 * first whose trailer matches. analysis/RE_walkmanone_installers.md, 2026-09-29.
 *
 * WHY A HELPER: the tables are applied by writing them into /proc/icx_audio_cxd3778gf_data/, which
 * is `-rw------- root root`. cinder-home and its launcher both run as uid 100. `load_sony_driver`
 * re-applies the stock table on EVERY boot, so this has to run every boot too — it is not an
 * install-time patch.
 *
 * SAFETY. The argument is a keyword from a fixed whitelist, never a path: the caller cannot name a
 * file, so it cannot ask this to write arbitrary bytes into a kernel node. Sources are fixed paths
 * on /system, writable only by root; Cinder's own directory is filled only by the installer, after
 * a SHA-256 check. Each source is opened O_NOFOLLOW, verified to be a regular file of the exact size
 * every one of these tables has and to end with the trailer of the table the key names, and copied
 * whole. Nothing about the destination comes from the caller.
 *
 * This changes what every volume step does. It does NOT raise the maximum — both curves reach the
 * same ceiling — but at a given number the WM1A curve is quieter through the mid range, so it is a
 * change to tell the user about, not to slip in.
 *
 * `eq G1..G5` is the one form that takes more than a keyword: five whole numbers, half-dB steps in
 * a fixed range, from which the helper computes a codec EQ table itself (src/codec_eq.h). Still no
 * path and no bytes from the caller; the base is a Sony tone table found and checked as above.
 *
 * `curve BASE P0..P120` is the other: seven whole numbers naming which of the base table's own
 * steps each of volume 0, 20 … 120 plays (src/vol_curve.h). Again no path and no bytes.
 *
 * Exit: 0 ok, 2 bad/absent argument, 3 not setuid root, 4 source unreadable/wrong, 5 write failed.
