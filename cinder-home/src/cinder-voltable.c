/* cinder-voltable — install one of Sony's output volume tables. Setuid root.
 *
 * WHY: the wired volume curve is a table the codec driver loads at boot, and the one this model
 * gets is measurably poor (analysis/RE_volume_pop.md): 40 of the 120 UI steps do nothing —
 * vol 40..60 and vol 100..120 are both dead — and the live steps get coarser toward the top, which
 * is where the volume-change pop is worst.
 *
 * Sony ships a better one on every stock device. `ov_127x.tbl` is the NW-WM1A's own curve: no dead
 * zones, the whole range usable, and smaller steps at the top. Measured, same instrument, on this
 * unit:
 *
 *     vol      0   20   40   60   80   90  100  110  120
 *     stock    4   80  100  100  148  188  228  228  228     <- two dead zones
 *     wm1a     4   44   84  124  164  184  204  224  228     <- monotonic
 *
 * (`ov_1280.tbl`, Walkman One's, measured IDENTICAL to stock — the model swap does not change the
 * volume curve. It is offered here only so that can be re-checked without a reinstall.)
 *
 * WHY A HELPER: the tables are applied by writing them into /proc/icx_audio_cxd3778gf_data/, which
 * is `-rw------- root root`. cinder-home and its launcher both run as uid 100. `load_sony_driver`
 * re-applies the stock table on EVERY boot, so this has to run every boot too — it is not an
 * install-time patch.
 *
 * SAFETY. The argument is a keyword from a fixed whitelist, never a path: the caller cannot name a
 * file, so it cannot ask this to write arbitrary bytes into a kernel node. The source is opened
 * O_NOFOLLOW under a hardcoded directory, verified to be a regular file of the exact size every one
 * of these tables has, and copied whole. Nothing about the destination comes from the caller.
 *
 * This changes what every volume step does. It does NOT raise the maximum — both curves reach the
 * same ceiling — but at a given number the WM1A curve is quieter through the mid range, so it is a
 * change to tell the user about, not to slip in.
 *
 * Exit: 0 ok, 2 bad/absent argument, 3 not setuid root, 4 source unreadable/wrong, 5 write failed.
