**A replacement music player for the Sony NW-A55 Walkman and the rest of the NW-A50 series.**
It replaces Sony's music app with a faster one and keeps Sony's audio services, effects and DAC path
underneath. Install it from a PC over USB; the same installer puts Sony's app back.

> This is a personal project that was made for myself. If people want to tweak it and adapt it to
> their own use, please do, but I can't promise features or time for it. Raise issues in the issues
> section, but I can't promise they will be patched. **Back up before you install**
> ([how](#install)), and if you have the time and skill, please contribute pull requests.
>
> I have deliberately not included any way to sponsor or pay for this project. I want it to be free,
> and I don't want the obligation for support that comes with payment; as I said, I made this for me.
>
> I am aware that using AI to create this is an unpopular decision, but I do not have the time or
> skill to make it in a "morally correct" way. Every feature that is added is based on whether I think
> it will be useful, helpful or if it is requested. This project came from me wanting something that
> didn't exist to the level I wanted it at the time.
>
> I do hope in time a community will form around this project and that people will support it and use
> it in every way that they want to. I hope Cinder does what you want it to; if not, make a request!
> The best way to support it is to test, give feedback and patch.
>
> **Cinder is still in testing and development, whatever GitHub's labels say. Updates are always
> being pushed (at the moment at least).**

## What you get

- **Fast.** About 5.7 MB of native code, no UI framework. Sony's app is Qt.
- **A real queue.** Up Next with play next, drag to reorder, and playlists made on the player.
- **Your library as it is.** Cinder reads Sony's database, so music, playlists and liked songs stay.
  It also plays albums kept as one file with a `.cue` sheet, lists audiobooks by series, and
  searches artists, albums and audiobooks as well as songs.
- **Short track previews.** A standalone retro page previews the current queue for 4 or 15 seconds
  per track, using existing Sony chorus markers when available ([controls and behaviour](docs/TRACK_PREVIEWS.md)).
- **USB-DAC in, LDAC out, at once.** Use the Walkman as a PC sound card and send the audio on to
  Bluetooth headphones. Sony's app blocks this; the hardware doesn't. An optional low-latency USB
  DAC (about 50 ms, headphone jack only) is there for video and games, and switches off again
  without a restart.
- **All of Sony's sound features:** DSEE HX and DSEE AI, VPT, Clear Phase, DC Phase Linearizer,
  Vinyl Processor, Clear Bass, the 10-band EQ and tone control. Cinder drives Sony's own services
  rather than reimplementing them. On top: an EQ in the DAC chip itself, named presets (one per
  album or song if you like), your own volume curve, and a signal path that says what costs battery.
- **Bluetooth codecs:** LDAC as Sony ships it, plus optional AAC and SBC XQ.
- **Better battery.** With the screen off, Cinder powers the display hardware down and lets the chip
  reach its deepest idle state. Sony's audio path is untouched.
- **Extras:** a `.scrobbler.log` scrobbler, lyrics (`.lrc` or embedded), SensMe™ channels, FM
  radio with a signal meter and recording, ATRAC files, and colour palettes you drop on the drive
  ([share and download them](https://github.com/superwilso/cinder-themes)).
- **Your layout.** Open on the Library, Now Playing, the Menu or wherever you left off. Six Now
  Playing styles: Cinder, Nocturne, Terminal, Clock, Cassette (with your own tapes) and Winamp
  (with classic `.wsz` skins). Big view for larger text and buttons, your own font, and an optional
  pull-down panel for brightness, Bluetooth, night mode and the sleep timer.
- **Your language.** English and Simplified Chinese, chosen in the installer, and a
  [guide](docs/LOCALIZATION.md) for adding another.

## Status

A daily player on the developer's own unit. Every [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) entry says whether
it has run on hardware (*device-verified*). Per-feature state: [`cinder-home/STATUS.md`](cinder-home/STATUS.md).

**Known issues**

- **v0.3.9 doesn't start after a fresh install** ([#16](../../issues/16)). Fixed in **v0.3.12**:
  install it over the top.
- **Bluetooth receiver mode (Walkman as a speaker) is experimental.** Playing from a Windows PC
  works. iPhones won't connect, and some don't list the Walkman at all.
- **Experimental options**, off by default: the low-latency USB DAC, FM recording, ATRAC playback
  and the macOS installer. Each one's state is in [`cinder-home/STATUS.md`](cinder-home/STATUS.md).
- **One test unit.** Other NW-A50-series models share its firmware but haven't been tried.

## Supported players

| Player | Already on it | Cinder | Run on the developer's A55 |
|---|---|---|---|
| NW-A55 | Sony stock 1.02 | **Supported.** The main target. | Daily, now |
| NW-A55 | Stock 1.02 + Wampy | **Supported.** Install over it; Wampy can stay ([below](#with-wampy-installed)). | Daily, July–September 2026 |
| NW-A55 | Walkman One 3.02 | **Supported.** A few sound features differ ([Walkman One](#walkman-one)). | Daily, September–October 2026 |
| NW-A55 | Walkman One 3.02 + Wampy | **Supported.** Install over it; Wampy can stay. | Late September 2026 |
| NW-A55 | Other stock or Walkman One versions | **Not tried.** | — |
| NW-A56 / A57 | Any of the above | **Should work.** Same firmware as the A55; no reports yet. | — |
| A40 / A30 series, ZX300, WM1A/Z, DMP-Z1 | Anything | **Not supported.** Use [Wampy](https://github.com/unknown321/wampy), which covers the whole MT8590 family. If you own one and can test, get in touch through GitHub. | — |

A [device report](../../issues/new/choose) for a row marked "should work" or "not tried" helps,
whether it works or not.

### With Wampy installed

You don't need to uninstall Wampy first.

- **Files:** Cinder keeps its files in its own folder and leaves Wampy's alone.
- **Wampy's screen:** it doesn't appear while Cinder runs. Wampy draws over Sony's music app, and
  Cinder takes that app's place.
- **Uninstalling Cinder** brings Sony's app back, and Wampy works over it as before.
- **Mono and soundscapes over music:** the `preload` install option loads Cinder's library into
  Sony's sound service after Wampy's, and Wampy's library still loads.
- **Scrobbling:** Wampy's scrobbler keeps running. Cinder writes no `.scrobbler.log` of its own
  while Wampy's scrobbler is running, so no play is counted twice.

## Install

1. **Back up the player with [wbrt](https://github.com/unknown321/wbrt)** (Windows). It is the
   proven way back for a player that no longer starts. Cinder's own `cinder-rescue` (on the
   [Releases](../../releases) page from v0.3.21-rc1; double-click it for a page with every step on
   buttons) can take a second backup and put back only the partitions a boot loop broke
   ([`RECOVERY.md`](RECOVERY.md) Step 3), but it has run on one player so far. Until it has run on
   more, keep a wbrt backup as well.
2. Download the installer from [Releases](../../releases):
   - **Windows:** `cinder-installer-windows-x64.exe`. Accept the administrator prompt; the last step
     needs raw drive access.
   - **Linux:** `cinder-installer-linux-x64`, run with `sudo`.
   - **macOS** (experimental): `cinder-installer-macos`, run with `sudo`. Not yet tried on a real
     Mac with a player; Windows or Linux is the sure route.
3. Connect the Walkman in USB mass-storage mode, run the installer, choose **Install** and your
   options. The player reboots into its updater, installs, and starts Cinder. **Leave the cable in
   until it does.**

The installer also has **Update** (keeps your choices) and **Uninstall** (restores Sony's app; music
and settings are untouched). It reads the player's logs, so it reports what is really installed.
The `.exe` is unsigned; check it against `SHA256SUMS` on the release.

**Want to try what's coming?** The [edge](../../releases/tag/edge) pre-release is an untested build
of the newest commit, published now and then between releases. It installs the same way, it can be
broken, and running the latest release's installer puts you back. Mention the version it prints
(`…-edge.<commit>`) when you report something.

Every option, and the developer build: [`install.md`](install.md). Removing it: [`UNINSTALL.md`](UNINSTALL.md).

## If something goes wrong

Each way back to Sony's player depends on less than the one before:

- **Boot with the USB cable connected** → Sony's player. Needs no filesystem. (The first boot after
  an install ignores the cable once.)
- **A file named `cinderhome_off` on the drive** → Sony's player until you delete it.
  `cinderhome_clear` clears a latched failure and tries Cinder again.
- **A build that fails to start** reverts to Sony's player by itself after four boots.
- **A player that doesn't start at all** still has MediaTek's download mode, before any of its
  software: restore your wbrt backup, or put back just the broken partitions with
  `cinder-rescue restore`.

Read [`RECOVERY.md`](RECOVERY.md) **before** you need it. Attach `cinderhome.log` (root of the
drive) to any issue.

## Walkman One

Cinder runs on Walkman One 3.02 as well as on Sony's stock 1.02, and installs the same way: Walkman
One changes the key Sony's updater accepts, and the installer asks the player for its key and
writes the package that key opens. Everything in Cinder works there except:

- **VPT Surround, Clear Phase and DSEE AI** aren't in Walkman One's sound library. Cinder shows
  them as unavailable rather than letting a tap do nothing.
- **Clear Bass** isn't in Walkman One's sound effects either. The install option *Clear Bass
  (Walkman One 3.02 only)* puts it back, in place of the DC Phase Linearizer.
- **Noise cancelling** (Sony's NC earphones): Walkman One never starts Sony's noise-cancelling
  engine, so Cinder starts it when you switch NC on. Ambient sound isn't available: Walkman One
  removed its filter.
- **Other versions** of Walkman One haven't been tried.

Coming from Walkman One:

- **Sound:** Walkman One's plus modes are a 3-byte change to Sony's audio library. Cinder's
  *Sound signature* install option makes the same change to your own stock files, no flashing. Its
  external tunings are other models' firmware and can't be reproduced. Measured at the jack, neither
  changes the signal ([unknown321's measurements](https://github.com/unknown321/wampy/blob/master/MAKING_OF_VOLUME_TABLES.md#there-is-more)).
- **Volume curve:** Cinder removes Sony's regional volume limit by default; the *Headphone volume
  curve* option **Sony, with region limit** keeps it. **Smooth (NW-WM1A)** is a choice there too, if
  you supply Sony's table file ([how](install.md#the-volume-curve-tables)).
- **Reverting to stock first** works; Cinder installs on stock 1.02. If it then doesn't start,
  you're on v0.3.9 ([#16](../../issues/16)): use a newer release.

UI work needs no device: `cd player && cargo run --release -p cinder-host` renders every screen to

[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) Parts A–D.
