## Installing

Download **cinder-installer-windows-x64.exe**, connect the Walkman in USB mass-storage
mode, and run it. Double-clicking opens a window; running it from a terminal gives the
same thing as text.

It does three things:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Install** | Choose the optional components, stage them, flash. |
| **Update** | Reads the choices already on the player and keeps them, so a new build never silently resets a customised install. |
| **Uninstall** | Restores Sony's launch config from the backup the install made and removes Cinder's binaries. Your music, playlists and settings are untouched. |

**Stable is for almost everyone.** On the Device page, **Build** offers a Developer build too: the
same player with a USB command line (adb) and test tools, for helping find a bug when someone asks
you for it. Keep Stable otherwise.

It reads what is on the player out of the device's own install log before offering
anything — whether Cinder is there, which version put it there, and whether the last
attempt succeeded, was reverted by the device's sanity gate, or never finished.

Everything the installer needs is inside the one file: the device binaries, both `.UPG`
packages and the component catalogue. **No separate download, no WSL, no usbipd, no driver
setup, and no network connection.** It sends the player's own upgrade command itself — SCSI
pass-through on Windows (so it asks for administrator), `SG_IO` on Linux (so it asks for
`sudo`). Sony's updater is no longer embedded in it.

Command line, if you prefer it:

```
cinder-installer --install | --update | --uninstall
cinder-installer --clean       # delete staged payload files left in the drive root
cinder-installer --check       # ask GitHub whether a newer release exists
cinder-installer -y            # no questions
```

### Linux

`cinder-installer-linux-x64` does the whole job — **run it with `sudo`**. It stages the
files and then sends the upgrade command itself: the same 12-byte vendor SCSI command
Sony's tool ends with. Root is needed because that is a raw SCSI passthrough. Without
it, the files are still staged correctly and the installer says what did not happen.

### macOS (experimental)

`cinder-installer-macos` runs on Apple Silicon and Intel Macs, and must be **run with `sudo`**.
It stages the files, ejects the player's volume, and sends the upgrade command as raw USB,
because macOS gives no SCSI passthrough for a mounted disk. It has not yet been run on a real
Mac. If it fails, finish from Linux or Windows; see [install.md](../blob/main/install.md).

### cinder-rescue (experimental): back up, and get a looping player back

`cinder-rescue-windows-x64.exe`, `cinder-rescue-linux-x64` and `cinder-rescue-macos` back up the
player's eMMC over MediaTek's download mode, which works even when the player will not start,
and later restore only the partitions a boot loop breaks, only to the player the backup came from.
Take the backup while the player still works. Steps, and the two things it needs that are not
in this release (MediaTek's Download Agent file, and on Windows a WinUSB driver): RECOVERY.md,
Step 3. Run on Windows with an NW-A55; not yet run on Linux or a Mac. `cinder-rescue licences`
prints the notices it carries.

The Mac installer and all three cinder-rescue builds contain [libusb](https://libusb.info)
1.0.27, linked statically. libusb is licensed under the GNU LGPL 2.1; its licence is
`LICENSE-libusb.txt` in `cinder-extras.zip`. Its source is at <https://github.com/libusb/libusb/tree/v1.0.27>. To
relink either program against a different libusb, build it from this release's tagged source
(`installer/` or `rescue/`, `cargo build --release`) with your own libusb.

> **The player has no update option in its own menus.** This generation never had one —
> the upgrade is always triggered by the host over USB.

`cinder-payload.tar.gz` is the device side every installer above embeds (both builds), for building
an installer from this release's source; `PAYLOAD.sha256` in the tagged source lists its checksums.

`cinder-extras.zip` holds the install and uninstall `.UPG` packages for that route and for
advanced recovery use (`.nw-wm1a.upg` for a player running Walkman One; its README says which). On Windows, the one-click executable is the recommended
path — it does the handoff for you.

**Read [RECOVERY.md](../blob/main/RECOVERY.md) first.** This device has no public
DFU/EDL recovery path.

## Verifying the download

GitHub shows a `sha256:` digest beside each file in the assets list above, computed when the file
was uploaded. `SHA256SUMS`, attached, holds the same sums as the build runner computed them before
upload; they should agree. On Linux or macOS, next to the downloads:

```bash
sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS
```

On Windows:

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\cinder-installer-windows-x64.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```

Every file above also has a GitHub build attestation. With the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com)
2.49 or later (older versions, including the 2.45 Ubuntu packages, do not have this command):

```
gh attestation verify cinder-installer-windows-x64.exe -R superwilso/Cinder
```

A pass means the file was built by this repository's release workflow from the tagged commit, and
is signed in a way an uploaded replacement cannot fake. The checksums say the file is intact; the
attestation says where it came from.

The installer is unsigned, so SmartScreen will warn about an unknown publisher — that
is expected for an unsigned binary and is not itself evidence of anything. Check the
hash if you want more than my word for it.
