// ── the firmware-upgrade trigger, on Windows ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACED. Until 0.3.1 this section launched Sony's own `SoftwareUpdateTool.exe` from
// a temporary directory, and every Windows installer carried Sony's updater — the .exe, Sony's
// `WmFwUpdater.dll` and Microsoft's Visual C++ 2010 runtime — embedded in it. That is Sony's
// software shipped inside a Cinder download, and it was the largest piece of someone else's
// property this project distributed.
//
// It was never needed for its own sake. Sony's tool ends in exactly one thing this installer
// already does on Linux: the 12-byte vendor SCSI command below, which tells the player to reboot
// into its updater and apply the `NW_WM_FW.UPG` sitting on its data partition. `write_payload`
// stages that file on every platform, so the tool was copying a file that was already there and
// then sending a command Windows can send itself.
//
// WHY IT NEEDS ADMINISTRATOR. The command goes to a *volume* handle (`\\.\E:`) opened for read
// and write, and Windows gives raw volume access only to an elevated process. That is why
// `cinder-installer.manifest` asks for `requireAdministrator` — the one thing in this installer
// that needs a right beyond writing files to a removable drive.

/// The vendor CDB. `fc` is Sony's NWZ passthrough opcode; subcommand `04` + the `dbmn` tag is
/// "do firmware upgrade". Byte 8 is a flag: newer devices want 0x80, older ones 0x00, so the
/// caller tries 0x80 first and falls back — the same two-shot `do_fw_upgrade` does.
///
/// The same twelve bytes go out on Linux through `SG_IO` and on Windows through SCSI
/// pass-through. Keeping one constant is deliberate: two copies of a device command drift.
