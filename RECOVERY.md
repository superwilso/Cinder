# NW-A55 Cinder — recovery runbook

If a flashed build misbehaves, work **top to bottom** — each step is more invasive than
the last. Most cases now self-heal at step 0.

## The escape ladder (rebuilt 2026-07-26 after a wbrt-requiring brick)

Each rung depends on **less** than the one below it, so try them in this order. This ordering is
the whole design: the 2026-07-26 brick happened because every escape that existed depended on
`/contents`, and `/contents` was the thing that had failed.

| # | Escape | Depends on |
|---|--------|-----------|
| 0 | **Boot with the USB cable connected → stock.** Except the first boot after an install or update: the installer leaves a one-shot pass so the player comes back on Cinder with the cable still in, and the launcher spends that pass on that boot whether Cinder starts or not. The boot after it escapes again. | Nothing. No filesystem, no shell, no counter. (A pass the launcher cannot delete is ignored, so a broken `/data` leaves the escape on.) |
| 0b | **Press POWER while the Sony logo shows → stock**, for that boot only (verified 2026-09-11). Once or twice while the logo is up: a press in its first second or two is before the kernel, and after the launcher runs (~10 s) is too late. Holding POWER to switch on is one press and never counts. | The kernel's own log and a shell. No filesystem, no counter. |
| 1 | **Bad-boot counter** hits `MAXBAD=4` → stock, by itself. | A writable `/data` (ext4). |
| 2 | `/contents/cinderhome_off` over USB-MSC → stock. | A mountable `/contents` + a PC. |
| 3 | `/contents/cinderhome_clear` over USB-MSC → clears the latch, tries again. | Same. |
| 4 | Flash `cinder_home_uninstall.upg`. | The Sony updater boots. |
| 5 | `cinder-rescue restore` from your own backup (Step 3): the broken partitions, or `--parts all`. | Nothing but the preloader in boot0. Never touches `/contents`. Takes a `cinder-rescue` backup or a wbrt one, but only of this player. |
| 6 | `wbrt` eMMC restore (Step 4). | Nothing — but it rolls back `/contents` too. |

### What survives kernel work (audited 2026-08-18)

Everything above assumes the main kernel boots. **Kernel work breaks that assumption**, so the
ladder has to be re-read for it. Facts, all verified on the live device:

**wbrt still covers you — for module work and even for a bad `bootimg`.** wbrt is
`flash_tool.exe` + `MTK_AllInOne_DA_5.2136.bin`, its driver binds `VID_0E8D&PID_2000`
("MT65xx **Preloader**"), and its backup length is hardcoded `2885156864` bytes from **user-area
offset 0**. Against `/proc/dumchar_info`:

| region | where | inside wbrt's 2.68 GB? |
|---|---|---|
| `preloader` | `/dev/misc-sd` = eMMC **boot0**, outside the user area | **NO — never backed up, never restored** |
| `uboot` (LK) | `mmcblk0p7` @ 0x2120000 | yes |
| `bootimg` — where kernel work lands | `mmcblk0p8` @ 0x2180000, 16 MB | yes |
| `recovery` | `mmcblk0p9` @ 0x3180000, 16 MB | yes |
| `nvp` / `android` / `usrdata` | p22 / p19 / p28 | yes |
| `contents` | `mmcblk0p29` @ 0x92f80000 | first ~400 MB only |

So the only thing wbrt cannot rewrite is the preloader in boot0 — and nothing in the FM kernel
plan writes there. **Never write boot0.** That is the one action with no way back.

`/proc/sys/kernel/panic` = **5** and `panic_on_oops` = **1** (`CONFIG_PANIC_TIMEOUT=5`), so an oops
or panic auto-reboots after 5 s instead of hanging silently. Every reboot re-runs the preloader, so
wbrt's catch window recurs — the same trick Steps 3 and 4 rely on.

**But rungs 0-4 mostly do not survive.** Rungs 0-3 are all userspace — cable escape, bad-boot
counter, `/contents` flags — and every one needs the main kernel to boot. Rung 4 is armed by
`scsitool do_fw_upgrade` over USB-MSC, which also needs a booting main kernel. A dead `bootimg`
therefore drops you from rung 0 straight to rung 5.

**There is probably a kernel-independent rung 4, but it is UNPROVEN.** `recovery` (`mmcblk0p9`) is
a fully self-contained updater: its own kernel (3,822,632 B) and its own 3.8 MB ramdisk of 133
entries, whose `init.rc` ends in

```
exec /bin/sh /install_update_script/icx_start_update.sh
```

with every `mount ... /system|/data|/db` line commented out (`#@`). It depends on neither `bootimg`
nor the `android` partition. LK carries the standard Android BCB (`boot-recovery`,
`mboot_recovery_load_misc`) plus an `MT65XX_RECOVERY_KEY` combo. Two things would have to be armed
**from a working system, before the risky boot**: the `misc` BCB (`mmcblk0p11`, currently all
zeros) and NVP `fup` (currently `0xFFFFFFFF`; `icx_start_update.sh` hard-requires `0x70555766`).
Nobody has tested this. Until someone does, treat a bad `bootimg` as "download mode only": Step 3 (`cinder-rescue restore --parts bootimg`) or Step 4 (wbrt).

**Therefore the working rule for kernel work:**

| what you do | worst case | needs wbrt? |
|---|---|---|
| `insmod` by hand over adb | panic -> 5 s -> reboot -> module gone, self-healed | no |
| module loaded from the launcher at boot | bad-boot counter -> stock, taking the module load with it | no |
| **replace the kernel in `bootimg`** | no boot; rungs 0-4 all gone | **yes** |

Stay in the first two rows. The third is the only tier that bets the device on wbrt, and no FM work
so far justifies going there.

**Rung 0 is the important one, and 0b is the one to reach for without a PC.** Plug the cable in, power on, and you land on stock — no matter
how broken the filesystem is. The cost is that charging at boot also lands on stock; turn that off
for cable-heavy dev with `/data/cinder/cable_escape_off` (or `/contents/cinderhome_cable_off`).

**Why state lives on `/data`:** the counter used to live on `/contents`, which is **vfat** (no
journal) *and* is the partition handed to the PC for USB-MSC — so it is both corruptible and
routinely absent. When it failed to mount, the counter write went nowhere, the launcher's
`>/contents/cinderhome.log` redirect failed, `sh` exited **without exec'ing**, appmgr rebooted, and
the loop repeated forever with the safety net silently disabled. State is now on `/data`
(ext4, journaled, never touched by USB-MSC), the launcher refuses to run at all if it cannot
persist the counter, and the log redirect can no longer block the exec.

Other guardrails:
- **Never SIGKILL the stock Qt app.** It is frozen, not killed *(a true kill caused the
  2026-06-23 boot loop)*. In the current design `.appcfg` is repointed and the Qt binary is
  never touched at all.
- **Missing-binary guard.** No executable `cinder-home` → the launcher runs stock untouched.
- **Verified copies.** Install is atomic (temp → verify → mv) with a final sanity gate that
  reverts to stock if any piece is wrong.
- **Recovery gate in the build.** `cinder-home/tools/test_launcher.sh` drives the generated
  launcher through all 44 escape/failure/supervisor checks in a sandbox; `build.sh` refuses to
  pack if any fail. It is what caught the special-builtin `exec`-redirect bug above.

### The crash supervisor (added 2026-07-29)

The launcher no longer `exec`s cinder-home — it **stays alive and respawns it**. Before this, a
single segfault or allocation failure cost a full reboot: appmgr installs a `SIGCHLD` handler
(`AppManagerService::OnInit` → `sigaction(17, …)`) and `android_reboot`s on
*"Application process is killed! appmgrservice will exit…"*. Staying alive suppresses that
entirely, because appmgr's `SIGCHLD` only fires for **its own direct child** — it
`fork()`+`execvp()`s the launcher and waits on that pid (`ProcessController::WaitFinished`), so a
live shell reaping cinder-home itself looks exactly like a healthy foreground app. Same reason
`SIGSTOP` on the stock Qt app was safe where `SIGKILL` was not.

Only deaths that mean *"crashed"* are respawned — it is a **whitelist**, so an unrecognised exit
code falls through to the old reboot-and-count behaviour rather than disabling the net:

| Exit | Meaning | Supervisor |
|---|---|---|
| 132–136, 139, 141, 158/159 | ILL / TRAP / ABRT / BUS / FPE / SEGV / PIPE / XCPU-XFSZ | **respawn** |
| 0 | deliberate exit — Settings ▸ System ▸ Boot to stock arms its flag then `_exit(0)` and *relies* on appmgr rebooting | hand back |
| 42 | self-diagnosed fatal (guard / watchdog), whose contract is "die fast so the counter reverts" | hand back |
| 143 / 137 | SIGTERM / SIGKILL — somebody killed us on purpose | hand back |
| anything else | unknown | hand back |

Escalation: **3 consecutive crashes inside 30 s**, or **10 crashes in one boot**, hands that boot
to the Sony player. Deliberately **not** a latch — the next boot tries Cinder again, because
latching on a runtime crash is how a device ends up stuck on stock forever.

**Kill switch** — restores the pre-supervisor `exec`, and depends on strictly less than the
supervisor it disables:
```bash
: > /tmp/cinderhome_norespawn
tools/flash.sh --push /tmp/cinderhome_norespawn   # or: touch /data/cinder/no_respawn
```

## Step 0 — plug in the USB cable and power on
That is the escape. You land on stock. If you want the counter to do it instead, leave the device
alone for ~4 boot attempts.

## Step 1 — manual escape hatch over USB-MSC
If it's stable enough to mount as USB-MSC, the installer does this for you: open it and choose
**Fix a problem**, then **Start Cinder again** (clears the latch and retries the installed build),
**Use Sony's player once**, or **Keep using Sony's player** (until you choose Start Cinder again).
Each drops or removes one of the files below on the player's drive. By hand, from Linux:
```bash
tools/flash.sh --clear-latch             # arms cinderhome_clear -> retry the installed build
: > /tmp/cinderhome_off
tools/flash.sh --push /tmp/cinderhome_off  # stock UI on next boot
```

## Step 2 — flash the uninstaller
Removes the wrapper entirely and restores the original scrobbler. In the installer: **Remove
Cinder**. By hand, from Linux:
```bash
tools/flash.sh uninstall
```
The next boot enters the Sony updater (which never runs the wrapper), so this breaks a loop.

## Step 3 — cinder-rescue: put back only what broke
`cinder-rescue` (in `rescue/`) talks to the same MediaTek download mode wbrt uses, so it works
on a player that will not boot. From v0.3.21-rc1 it is on the Releases page for Windows, Linux and
macOS; or build it with `cargo build --release` in `rescue/`. Verified on an A55 under Windows:
backup and restores of `bootimg` and `cache` on 2026-10-26, then on 2026-10-28 the DA download, a
full compare, the serial check a wbrt backup uses, and a full restore, all from the page. Not yet
run on Linux or a Mac. Until it has run on more players, keep a wbrt backup as well (Step 4).

**Double-click it** and it opens a page in your browser with everything below on buttons: Back up,
Restore (Compare first, then Restore), Backups (Check) and Connection (Test, and on Windows the USB
driver). The page is served by cinder-rescue to this PC only, and its window has to stay open while
you use it. On Linux, run it with `sudo` (USB access); the page still opens as you. Everything below
also works from a terminal, with the same commands.

**Take its backup while the player still works.**
```
cinder-rescue dump --out a55-backup.bin     # about 21 minutes, read-only
```
That writes `a55-backup.bin` (the same range and raw format as a wbrt backup) and
`a55-backup.bin.manifest` (chip, eMMC ID, a SHA-256 for each partition), then reads the file
back against the manifest. `cinder-rescue verify a55-backup.bin` repeats that check any time.
Keep both files together. **A wbrt backup works too:** run `cinder-rescue verify` on it once to
give it a manifest.

**When it loops**, put back the partitions that broke, usually `bootimg` (kernel work) or
`android` (the system partition), or everything:
```
cinder-rescue restore --from a55-backup.bin --parts bootimg --dry-run   # compares, writes nothing
cinder-rescue restore --from a55-backup.bin --parts bootimg
cinder-rescue restore --from a55-backup.bin --parts all                 # every partition but your music
```
Before writing anything it checks:
- the backup against its manifest;
- that the player is the one the backup came from: the same chip and eMMC ID, or for a wbrt
  backup, which records neither, the same serial number (in `nvp`);
- that the backup's partition table has the A50-series layout, and the player's too unless the
  table itself is being put back.

Then it compares the player with the backup 64 MiB at a time, writes only the 1 MiB pieces that
differ, and reads every written piece back. A `--dry-run` says how much of each partition differs.
`contents` (your music) is never written: a backup holds only its first ~400 MB, and putting that
back over a drive whose files have moved on would corrupt it. `usrdata` is `/data`: restoring it
rolls Cinder's settings back too. After a restore that wrote anything before `bootimg` (the
partition table, `nvram`, the bootloader), unplug the cable and hold POWER to start the player;
otherwise it restarts by itself.

**What it needs:**
- **The Download Agent**, MediaTek's file, which is not shipped here. Without `--da`, cinder-rescue
  uses a `DA.bin` beside it, or downloads mtkclient's `MTK_DA_V5.bin` (wbrt's release if that
  fails) and saves it as `DA.bin`. Whatever the source, it uses a DA only if the two stages it sends
  the player are byte-for-byte the ones verified on the A55. `--da FILE` uses your own.
- **On Windows, a WinUSB driver** for `VID_0E8D&PID_2000` ("MT65xx Preloader").
  `cinder-rescue driver`, from a terminal opened as administrator, installs it the way wbrt does
  (libwdi's `wdi-simple`, from the same release). wbrt's driver works too. On Linux it needs root
  or a udev rule for that device.
- **Download mode**: unplug the cable, switch the player off (hold POWER about 10 s if it is
  looping), hold **Play + Volume Down**, plug the cable in, and let go when the tool moves on. A
  normal reboot never offers it. If the tool stops with an error, the player stays in download
  mode until you unplug it and hold POWER about 10 s.

## Step 4 — wbrt eMMC restore (guaranteed; native Windows)
This is brick-insurance and works even in a hard boot loop, because it catches the device in
**MediaTek mode at the very start of boot**, before any of our code runs.

- Backup file: wherever you saved your `wbrt` Backup output (see the note above — take a fresh one
  before every Restore, and never overwrite your known-good image).
- Tool: `walkman-backup-restore-tool` — `github.com/unknown321/wbrt/releases`
- Driver: the MediaTek VCOM driver `wbrt`'s README links (device = `VID_0E8D&PID_2000`)

Steps: run the driver installer → run wbrt → **Backup first (see below)** → **Restore** → pick the
backup → get the device into MediaTek mode (below) → let it finish, don't disconnect.

> **Take a fresh Backup before you Restore.** A restore rewrites the *whole* eMMC, and `/contents`
> is inside it — the music library, playlists and `.scrobbler.log` all roll back to whatever the
> backup image contains. You are already in MediaTek mode with the tool open, so a backup costs
> ~20 more minutes and makes the current library recoverable from that image afterwards, even
> though the device won't boot. Save it to a **new filename**; never overwrite the known-good one.

### After a restore — what state you are actually in
A wbrt restore rewrites the **whole** eMMC from the backup image, so the device comes back as that
image was: **no `cinder-home`, no launcher, no `/contents` flags**, `.appcfg` stock, and the music
library rolled back to whatever the image held. Nothing of Cinder survives — there is no latch to
clear and no counter to reset.

Reinstalling is therefore a full install. Run the installer (`cinder-installer --install`; on
Linux with `sudo`): it stages every file the install needs and sends the update command itself.
Then boot with the cable OUT — a cable at boot is itself the escape to stock.

By hand, every file is a separate `SRC_*` the device script stages from the storage root and only
*warns* about if missing, so a partial push degrades silently: no `cinder-umount` → USB-MSC cannot
unmount `/contents`; no `cinder-power` → no Power off or Restart; no `cinder-msc` → no USB mass
storage; no `cinder-clock` → the clock cannot be set; no `cinder-fm` → the radio loses its signal
meter and its one-second scan. Push each file in `installer/build.rs`'s `FILES`, then
`tools/flash.sh cinder-home/dist/stable/cinder_home_install.upg`.

Then put back what was made on the player: playlists, likes, ratings and play counts, settings,
palettes and the play log. Flint copies these to the PC every time its window reads the player, so
the newest copy is from the last time Flint saw it: `flint restore E:\` lists the copies, and
`flint restore E:\ "<name>" --apply` puts one back (it copies the player as it is first). Restart
the player to read them.

### Getting a stubborn looping device into MediaTek mode (hard-won notes)
- **Detach usbipd first.** If the device is bound to WSL it's invisible to Windows/wbrt:
  `usbipd detach --busid <X>` and `usbipd unbind --busid <X>`; close any `--auto-attach` window.
  (Symptom: Device Manager shows *nothing* while it's plugged in and cycling.)
- **It won't power off because USB power reboots it — unplug the cable first**, then hold POWER
  ~15–20 s; keep holding *through* the dark screen (releasing at the dark moment lets it reboot).
- **Catching the preloader without powering off:** with wbrt at "waiting for device" and the
  correct driver, the ~1–2 s MediaTek preloader window at the start of every boot can be caught
  mid-loop.
- **Guaranteed:** leave it **unplugged and looping until the battery dies** (constant rebooting
  drains it in ~1–2 h). Once off, in wbrt start Restore → **hold VOL− and plug USB in while
  holding** → it enters BROM and holds there → restore.
- **Driver errors** ("Unrecognized device driver"/"Open failed"): `pnputil /enum-drivers`, then
  `pnputil -f -d oemNN.inf` for each `VID_0E8D&PID_2000` entry, reboot Windows, retry.
