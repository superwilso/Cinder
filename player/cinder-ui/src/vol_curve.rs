//! Sound ▸ Advanced ▸ Volume curve — the owner's own headphone volume curve.
//!
//! WHAT IT EDITS. Sony's volume table gives each of the 121 volume steps one row of codec register
//! values. This screen picks, for volume 0, 20, 40 … 120, WHICH of Sony's rows that step plays; the
//! steps between follow a straight line. The setuid `cinder-voltable curve stock P0 … P120` builds
//! the table from the player's own one (`cinder-home/src/vol_curve.h`), so nothing is ever played
//! that Sony's curve does not already contain, and the maximum cannot rise above Sony's.
//!
//! WHY. The stock A50 curve has dead steps: nothing changes from 100 to 120, and the analogue stage
//! sits still from 40 to 60 (`analysis/RE_volume_pop.md`). "Use every step" spreads 0..120 over
//! Sony's rows 0..100, so every press changes the level and the steps near the top are finer.
//!
//! A point can never be set below the one before it or above the one after: a curve that goes down
//! would make the volume control run backwards, and the helper refuses one anyway.
