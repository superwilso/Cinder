//! ordinary week (Display, Brightness, Screen-off timer, Sleep timer, Shuffle, Date & time, Device,
//! USB mode, Power off) and a last row, More settings. That row unfolds the rest below it, in
//! place — LIBRARY, POWER SAVING, SYSTEM, ABOUT — and folds it away again. Nothing was removed and
//! no row changed what it does; the set-once rows no longer stand between a thumb and Brightness.
//! Every row acts except Firmware and Model, which are information.
//!
//! Drawn with the redesign kit (`kit.rs`): 64 px rows, 34 px section labels. Theme, palette,
//! accent, text size and the visualiser moved to Settings ▸ Display (`display.rs`, handoff 5k) —
//! the things you change weekly no longer share a column with Restart and Reset.
