//! Menu (the hub) — design handoff 5a.
//!
//! ```text
//!   Menu
//!   NOW › Nils Frahm · Says · 4:12 of 8:18        the strip: tap it for Now Playing
//!   Library               3,184 songs … HOME ›    one kit row per destination, title + state
//!   …
//!   START ON
//!   [Library] [Now Playing] [Menu] [Last screen]  what the player opens on
//! ```
//!
//! The Now Playing row became the strip, because "what is playing" is a line of state and not a
//! place to go, and the strip is the kit's place for a line of state. Up Next left with it: the
//! queue is one tap from Now Playing's toolbar, where the thing it is the queue of is on screen.
//! The home-screen picker lives here rather than three levels into Settings — the handoff's reason
//! is that the Menu is where you are when you think "I wish it opened on…".
//!
//! The list does NOT scroll, so the pitch is sized to fit every row between the strip and the chips
//! — see [`row_h`]. Everything that positions or hit-tests a Menu row derives from it.
//!
//! Except in Big view, where squeezing defeated the point (its rows came out 63 px, not 80): the
//! rows keep the kit's pitch, START ON follows them with its chips two to a line ("Now Playing"
//! was cut four across), and the page scrolls under the strip. The geometry below is in page
//! coordinates; `nav` adds the scroll to a tap's y before asking.
