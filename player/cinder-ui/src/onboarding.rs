//! First-run onboarding + re-viewable Help/Controls. A short paged intro shown ONCE on first boot
//! (Welcome → Make it yours → Getting around → Buttons → Playing & Up Next → Gestures → Features →
//! Done),
//! persisted so it doesn't reappear; replayed from the last row of Menu ▸ Help & controls
//! (`help.rs`), which is the reference list kept after it.
//! Touch-navigated (the NW-A55 has no d-pad): tap the right side = next / finish, tap the left
//! side = back a page, left-edge swipe = skip.
//!
//! EVERY ROW IS SOMETHING THAT EXISTS, pinned to where it is implemented, because a help screen
//! that describes the app you meant to write is worse than none:
//!   * Getting around   -> `chrome::status_hit` (clock zone / bookmark / the rest), the header
//!     chevron + left-edge swipe (`nav::tap`, the shell's edge swipe), `now_playing::TOOLBAR_CX`
//!   * Playing & Up Next -> `Action::PlayListAt` / `PlayPlaylistAt` / album taps, `QueueAt`,
//!     `App::queue_shuffle`, `App::remove_upcoming`, `up_next::GRIP_X0`, `App::queue_clear`
//!   * Buttons          -> `App::power_held` (the Power menu), `App::set_hold`
