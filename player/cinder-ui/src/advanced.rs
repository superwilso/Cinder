//! Sound ▸ Advanced — the rest of Sony's effect surface.
//!
//! WHY A SUB-SCREEN. The Sound screen keeps the everyday rows; everything else Sony's chain offers
//! is here, in one place. Since 2026-10-19 that includes VPT Surround, DC Phase and the Vinyl
//! Processor, which used to unfold under a "More effects" row on Sound — a second hiding place
//! beside this one. They are the controls you set once for a pair of headphones, not the ones you
//! reach for per album. The list scrolls.
//!
//! WHAT IS AND IS NOT HERE. Everything on this screen is a control Sony's own firmware exposes and
//! Cinder did not. Deliberately absent:
//!   * ClearPhase Speaker / Wmport — the symbols exist, but they describe hardware an A55 does not
//!     have (same story as `smaster btl`). A row that cannot do anything is the exact class of lie
//!     this screen's neighbours have had cleaned out of them twice.
//!   * Tone Control's CENTRE FREQUENCIES. The three band gains got their own editor on 2026-08-17
//!     (`tone.rs`, reached from the row below the on/off); the centre frequencies did not, because
//!     `SetToneCenterFreq` echoes 0..7 with no dB twin and no recovered frequency list, so the
//!     picker would be showing numbers Cinder invented.
//!   * The 6-band EQ and Sony's named presets — those belong next to the EQ screen, not here.
//!
//! THE OVERRIDE BANNER is the point of the screen as much as the rows are. ClearAudio+ overrides
//! the manual EQ and DSP outright, and Source Direct bypasses the whole chain — measured on device,
//! and the reason a whole evening went into "why can I not hear VPT". When either is on, the rows
//! it hides are drawn dim and the banner says which one is doing it.
