//! Sound ▸ Advanced ▸ DAC EQ — five filters in the codec chip itself.
//!
//! WHAT THIS IS. The CXD3778GF has its own five-biquad EQ, loaded by the kernel from the "tone
//! control table" and re-applied on every output, amp, jack and resume change. Sony uses it only to
//! correct its own noise-cancelling headphones; for every other pair it is loaded flat. Cinder
//! fills the ordinary-headphone slots with this screen's five bands, through the setuid
//! `cinder-voltable eq` helper, which computes the coefficients itself from five whole numbers.
//! Decode and kernel trace: `analysis/RE_codec_tone_table.md`; the table builder and its self-test:
//! `cinder-home/src/codec_eq.h`, `cinder-home/tools/codeceq_selftest.cpp`.
//!
//! HOW IT DIFFERS FROM THE EQUALIZER AND TONE CONTROL. Those run in Sony's DSP, on the CPU, and
//! apply to Bluetooth as well. This one runs in the DAC after all of them, on the wired output
//! only, and is in the path with either of them.
//!
//! ASYMMETRIC RANGE, ON PURPOSE: -12 dB to +6 dB. The helper never lets the curve rise above 0 dB —
//! a boost is paid for by lowering everything else by the same amount — so a big boost buys mostly
//! a quieter player. Cuts are free.
//!
//! Source Direct flattens it (the shell applies a flat table while Direct is on): "bypasses every
//! effect" has to include this one.
